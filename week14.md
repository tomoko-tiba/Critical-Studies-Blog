  ## What is literacy and what does it mean to call computer programming a literacy.
  
  
Literacy refers to the ability to read and write, as well as the ability to understand and use complex written information in various contexts. It is considered a key life skill and a fundamental human right, as it enables individuals to access and understand information that can help them make informed decisions and participate fully in society.
  
When people refer to computer programming as a literacy, they are suggesting that it has become an essential and fundamental skill in today's society, just like reading and writing. With the increasing reliance on technology in virtually every aspect of our lives, the ability to understand and create digital systems and software is becoming increasingly important.

In this sense, computer programming literacy can be seen as the ability to understand and use computer languages to create and manipulate digital information and systems. It involves not only an understanding of programming concepts, but also the ability to think logically and solve problems using computational tools and techniques.

In the same way that traditional literacy enables individuals to access and understand information, computer programming literacy enables individuals to understand and participate in a technology-driven world. It provides individuals with the skills to create, manipulate, and understand digital systems, which are increasingly used in many areas of work and everyday life.
  
## After reading the materials, I think......
  
While the idea of computer programming literacy being an important part of communication skills in everyday life and an expansive form of literacy has many potential benefits, there are also some downsides to consider:

Digital Divide: Not everyone has equal access to computers and the internet, and many people lack the resources and opportunity to learn how to code. This digital divide may reinforce existing inequalities in society, and could lead to a situation where only a privileged few have the skills and knowledge to participate fully in a technology-driven world.

Job Automation: As automation and artificial intelligence become increasingly prevalent, there is a risk that many jobs will become automated, leaving people who do not have the skills and knowledge to adapt to a rapidly changing job market behind.

Dependence on technology: There is a concern that an overemphasis on coding literacy could lead to a situation where people become overly dependent on technology and lose the ability to solve problems and make decisions independently.

Bias in algorithms: Computer algorithms and programs are only as unbiased as the data and assumptions that are fed into them. If people with limited knowledge of programming and data analysis are creating algorithms, there is a risk that the algorithms will reflect the biases and limitations of their creators.

Overloading the curriculum: In an effort to make computer programming literacy more widespread, there may be a tendency to add coding to the curriculum in schools at the expense of other important subjects, such as the arts and humanities. This could lead to an imbalance in education and the development of a one-dimensional view of the world.

In conclusion, while the notion of computer programming literacy has many potential benefits, it is important to consider the potential downsides and address them in order to ensure that the benefits are distributed equitably and that technology is used in a way that benefits society as a whole.

# Exploring the Potential of Low-Tech Solutions: Reflections on Bibliotecha and Minor Technology.

One of the small-scale projects that caught my attention is the Solar Protocol (2021) by Tega Brain, Alex Nathanson, and Benedetta Piantella. This project explores the use of solar-powered digital devices and how they can create new opportunities for sustainable technology.

The Solar Protocol is a set of guidelines for designing solar-powered digital devices that are sustainable, durable, and socially responsible. The protocol includes recommendations for the use of low-power components, the integration of local materials and labor, and the adoption of open-source software and hardware.

One of the most interesting aspects of the Solar Protocol is its emphasis on the social impact of technology. As the creators state, "Technology is not neutral, and the ways in which it is designed and deployed have real-world social and environmental consequences." This idea is echoed in the work of Shannon Mattern, who notes that "technology is never neutral; it always embodies the values, biases, and interests of its makers and users."

The Solar Protocol offers a different approach to technology design, one that is centered on sustainability, social responsibility, and community empowerment. This approach resonates with the idea of "minor technology," which is defined by Jussi Parikka as "a technology that is small, accessible, and easy to use, and which enables a more sustainable and democratic future."

The Solar Protocol also challenges the dominant paradigm of technological development, which is focused on growth and profit rather than sustainability and social good. This is a key point made by Sylvia Federici, who argues that "the capitalist development of technology has resulted in an ecological crisis, social polarization, and the further exploitation of the global South."

Overall, the Solar Protocol is a great example of how minor technology can be used to create a more sustainable and socially responsible future. As the creators state, "we hope that the Solar Protocol will inspire more sustainable digital practices, and that it will contribute to a broader movement for digital justice and ecological resilience."
